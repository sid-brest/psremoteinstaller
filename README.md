Script Description

This PowerShell script automates the installation of any app across multiple remote computers in a local network. 
It reads a list of target computers from a specified file, copies the app installer to each remote computer, and installs app silently using a scheduled task with system privileges. 
After the installation, it cleans up by removing the temporary files and folders. 
The script ensures smooth installation by checking for connectivity issues and handling errors gracefully.
